                "An execution plan is a set of instructions for executing a query. Devised by the SQL Server Query Optimizer, an execution plan describes the set of operations that the execution engine needs to perform to return the data required by a query.\r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "The execution plan is your window into the SQL Server query optimizer and query execution engine. It will reveal which tables and indexes a query accessed, in which order, how they were accessed, what types of joins were used, how much data was retrieved initially, and at what point filtering and sorting occurred. It will show how aggregations were performed, how calculated columns were derived, how and where foreign keys were accessed, and more.\r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "Any problems created by the query will frequently be apparent within the execution plan, making it an excellent tool for troubleshooting poorly-performing queries. Rather than guess at why a query is sending your I/O through the roof, you can examine its execution plan to identify the exact operation, and associated section of T-SQL code, that is causing the problem. For example, the plan may reveal that a query is reading every row in a table or index, even though only a small percentage of those rows are being used in the query. By modifying the code within the WHERE clause, SQL Server may be able to devise a new plan that uses an index to find directly (or seek) only the required rows.\r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "This chapter will introduce execution plans. We'll explore the basics of obtaining an execution plan and start the process of learning how to read them, covering the following topics:\r\n",

                "* **A brief background on the query optimizer** – execution plans are a result of the optimizer's operations, so it's useful to know at least a little bit about what the optimizer does, and how it works.\r\n",

                "Every time we submit a query to SQL Server, several server processes kick into action; their job collectively is to manage the querying or modification of that data. Within the relational engine, the query is parsed by the Parser, bound by the Algebrizer and then finally optimized by the Query Optimizer, where the most important part of the work occurs. Collectively, we refer to these processes as query compilation. The SQL Server relational engine takes the input, which is the SQL text of the submitted query, and compiles it into a plan to execute that query. In other words, the process generates an execution plan, effectively a series of instructions for processing the query. \r\n",

The next time the optimizer sees the same query text, it will check to see if a plan for that SQL text exists in the plan cache. If it does, it will pass the cached plan on to the query execution engine, bypassing the full optimization process.\r\n",
                "The query execution engine will execute the query, according to the instructions laid out in the execution plan. It will generate calls to the storage engine, the process that manages access to disk and memory within SQL Server, to retrieve and manipulate data as required by the plan.\r\n",

                "### Query compilation phase\r\n",
                "Since execution plans are created and managed from within the relational engine, that's where we'll focus our attention in this book. The following sections review briefly what happens during query compilation, covering the parsing, binding, and particularly the optimization phase, of query processing. \r\n",
                "### Query parsing\r\n",
                "When a request to execute a T-SQL query reaches SQL Server, either an ad hoc query from a command line or application program, or a query in a stored procedure, user-defined function, or trigger, the query compilation and execution process can begin, and the action starts in the rel¬ational engine. \r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "As the T-SQL arrives in the relational engine, it passes through a process that checks that the T-SQL is written correctly, that it's well formed. This process is query parsing. If a query fails to parse correctly, for example, if you type SELETC instead of SELECT, then parsing stops and SQL Server returns an error to the query source. The output of the Parser process is a parse tree, or query tree (or it's even called a sequence tree). The parse tree represents the logical steps necessary to execute the requested query.\r\n",
                "### Query binding\r\n",
                "If the T-SQL string has parsed correctly, the parse tree passes to the algebrizer, which performs a process called query binding. The algebrizer resolves all the names of the various objects, tables, and columns referred to within the query string. It identifies, at the individual column level, all the data types (varchar(50) versus datetime and so on) for the objects being accessed. It also determines the location of aggregates, such as SUM and MAX, within the query, a process called aggregate binding. \r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "This algebrizer process is important because the query may have aliases or synonyms, names that don't exist in the database, that need to be resolved, or the query may refer to objects not in the database. When objects don't exist in the database, SQL Server returns an error from this step, defining the invalid object name (except in the case of deferred name resolution). As an example, the algebrizer would quickly find the table Person.Person in the AdventureWorks database. However, the Product.Person table, which doesn't exist, would cause an error and the whole compilation process would stop. \r\n",
                "### Stored procedure and deferred name resolution\r\n",
                "On creating a stored procedure, its statement text is parsed and stored in sys.sql_modules catalog view. However, the tables referenced by the text do not have to exist in the database at this point. This gives more flexibility because, for example, the text can reference a temporary table that is not created by the stored procedure, and does not yet exist, but that we know will exist at execution time. At execution time, the query processor finds the names of the objects referenced, in sys.sql_modules, and makes sure they exist.\r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "The algebrizer outputs a binary called the query processor tree, which is then passed on to the query optimizer. The output also includes a hash, a coded value representing the query. The optimizer uses the hash to determine whether there is already a plan for this query stored in the plan cache, and whether the plan is still valid. A plan is no longer considered valid after some changes to the table (such as adding or dropping indexes), or when the statistics used in the optimization were refreshed since the plan was created and stored. If there is a valid cached plan, then the process stops here and the cached plan is reused.\r\n",
                "## Query optimization\r\n",
                "The query optimizer is a piece of software that considers many alternate ways to achieve the requested query result, as defined by the query processor tree passed to it by the algebrizer. The optimizer estimates a \"cost\" for each possible alternative way of achieving the same result, and attempts to find a plan that is cheap enough, within as little time as is reasonable.\r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "Most queries submitted to SQL Server will be subject to a full cost-based optimization process, resulting in a cost-based plan. Some very simple queries can take a \"fast track\" and receive what is known as a trivial plan.\r\n",

                "* __Constraints__ – the primary keys, enforced and trusted referential constraints and any other types of constraints in place on the tables and columns that make up the query tell the optimizer the limits on possible data stored within the tables referenced.\r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "Using these inputs, the optimizer applies its model, essentially a set of rules, to transform the logical query tree into a plan containing a set of operators that, collectively, will physically execute the query. Each operator performs a dedicated task. The optimizer uses various operators for accessing indexes, performing joins, aggregations, sorts, calculations, and so on. For example, the optimizer has a set of operators for implementing logical join conditions in the submitted query. It has one specialized operator for a Nested Loops implementation, one for a Hash Match, one for a Merge, and one for an Adaptive Join.\r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "The optimizer will generate and evaluate many possible plans, for each candidate testing different methods of accessing data, attempting different types of join, rearranging the join order, trying different indexes, and so on. Generally, the optimizer will choose the plan that its calculations suggest will have the lowest total cost, in terms of the sum of the estimated CPU and I/O processing costs. \r\n",
                "During these calculations, the optimizer assigns a number to each of the steps within the plan, representing its estimation of the combined amount of CPU and disk I/O time it thinks each step will take. This number is the estimated cost for that step. The accumulation of costs for each step is the estimated cost for the execution plan itself. We'll shortly cover the estimated costs, and why they are estimates, in more detail.\r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "Plan evaluation is a heuristic process. The optimizer is not attempting to find the best possible plan but rather the lowest-cost plan in the fewest possible iterations, meaning the shortest amount of time. The only way for the optimizer to arrive at a perfect plan would be to be able to take an infinite amount of time. No one wants to wait that long on their queries.\r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "Having selected the lowest-cost plan it could find within the allotted number of iterations, the query execution component will use this plan to execute the query and return the required data. As noted earlier, the optimizer will also store the plan in the plan cache. If we submit a subsequent request with identical SQL text, it will bypass the entire compilation process and simply submit the cached plan for execution. A parameterized query will be parsed, and if a plan with a matching query hash is found in the cache, the remainder of the process is short-circuited.\r\n",

                "For very simple queries, the optimizer may simply decide to apply a trivial plan, rather than go through the full cost-based optimization process. The optimizer's rules for deciding when it can simply use a trivial plan are unclear, and probably complex. However, for example, a very simple query, such as a SELECT statement against a single table with no aggregates or calculations, as shown in Listing 1-1 would receive a trivial plan."

It’s worth noting that the ToolTip and the Properties for given operators change as SQL Server itself changes. You may see differences in the ToolTips between one version of SQL Server and the next. Most of the examples in this book are from SQL Server 2016.\r\n",

Thankfully, SQL Server 2008, and later, automatically selects the .sqlplan file type. \r\n",

For example, we can send the XML plan of a slow-running query to a DBA friend and ask them their opinion on how to rewrite the query. Once the friend receives the XML plan, he or she can open it up in Management Studio and review it as a graphical execution plan.\r\n",
