# Notebooks
I am learning how to create, publish, share, program, pretty much anything else I can do with Jupyter Notebooks. The current set under development here are all meant for use with Azure Data Studio and the Jupyter Notebook implementation there. I have no idea how well these will work in other tools.

## Notebook Purposes and Descriptions

*Your First Notebook:* An introduction to the concept of Jupyter Notebooks.

*Introduction to Containers:* A presentation on containers using a notebook to present from and to run all code samples from.

*Python to Control Docker:* Documentation of how I set up and manage Python in order to take control of Docker. This is built from the work I'm doing on the Introduction to Containers presentation.

*Execution Plans:* Chapters from my book on execution plans moved into a notebook so you can run the code from the book directly as you read.

*Create Database:* Not a notebook at all, but a set of scripts for a PostgreSQL database that I'm developing for demonstrations and tests. These are driven by accesss from Azure Data Studio through Notebooks, which is why I'm keeping it here.
