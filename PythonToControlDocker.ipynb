To do this, in a \"Code\" section of the notebook that is set to the kernal \"Python 3\", you'll want to use the \"Install Packages\" button. This opens a powershell terminal, which will prompt you:\r\n\r\n>> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n>> This is the sandboxed instance of python used by Jupyter server.\r\n>> To install packages used by the python kernel use '.\\python.exe -m pip install'\r\n>> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe command then to install docker would be:\r\n\r\n.\\python.exe -m pip install docker\r\n\r\nThis will then install the docker module within the Jupyter execution space (which is seperate from any installation of Python you have on the system)",
